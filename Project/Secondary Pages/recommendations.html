<h1> Recommendations for Spain </h1>


 Spain is a country where any type of tourist can be appeased. From the tourists who want to explore historical sites to tourists who just want to enjoy nature or perhaps want to go to a lively city. 
Spain has an abundance of things to offer. I've listed my personal recommendations of things that would interest me personally but I have included additional items which I think a variety of people would enjoy as well
